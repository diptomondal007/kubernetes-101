What!! What is this? Not making any sense. Should I eat the kubernetes or what!

Let's talk!

### Virtual Machines and their limitations
Early on people use to run their applications on physical servers. So some application used to take less resources than the server had and some application needed more resources. Scaling was dificult and so was resource utilization. Then concept of vm was introduced where you can run multiple virtual machines in a single physical machine. 
Wow! Now you can run multiple application in a single machine with isolated environment. But a small issue was still there. 

Each VM is a full machine running it's own operating system. The operating system needs some resources to run it's built in services which is waste of resources!
This is where the containerization concept comes in. It's possible to deploy multiple applications using the same operating system on a single virtual machine or server with containerization.
